Although apps exist that make the list-making process possible in the digital platform, an opportunity exists to make this task more efficient by learning and applying the user’s habits. buyList learns the user’s buying habits over time and uses that data to make the list-making process quick and intuitive in a fun, engaging user interface.</p></li>

              <p class="bodycopy">Grocery lists mostly involve the same items over and over occurring with approximately the same frequency depending on the user’s buying habits. Repetitive data entry becomes the norm.Different grocery items are usually bought from different stores. Existing grocery apps usually provide a platform for either a master list or different lists for different stores. Location services are not taken advantage of by improving user experiences.</p></div>

                <p class="bodycopy">buyList is your grocery’s new best friend. It learns your shopping behavior over time and keeps track of the quantity and frequency with which you buy a certain item, whilst geotagging the location/s where you usually pick them up from. It reminds you when you got to pick up milk so you don’t realize it when you are making coffee in the morning!</p>

              • So then the question arises, what features will convert a non-user to a user?<br>
              • What will bring users from other apps to this app?<br><br>

              What the research suggested was an app that learns the shopping behavior because most of the users buy most of the same things from the same store, at an almost predictable frequency.<br><br>
              An interesting feature, that could possibly hook or convert customer loyalty, would be an ability to add previously bought items seamlessly, with little to not resistance making the app as efficient as possible.

            <p class="bodycopy">The design process began with the dispersal of a user survey which was aimed to find out more about the current shopping habits of a typical user. What their pain points were? What were they looking for in an app? What would encourage them to start using an app if they don't use one currently? These were some of the questions that were surveyed.<br><br>

            User surveys indicated that most users don’t use a grocery app, mainly due to the fact they don’t know it exists or that they don’t find a need for it since they buy the same items repeatedly. However, when asked what the chances of forgetting to pick up something from the store was, the responses were not as overwhelming as expected, except for 14.3% who said that they forget things very frequently. Some of the other interesting takeaways are below.

        The main characteristics that tie the "feel" of the UX design are clean lines. Hence, sans-serif font families were preferred. The logo, which consists of the word ‘buyList’ in the Comfortaa font. The logo tick mark was encased in the b for a complete logo. The alphabet ‘b’ with the tick mark was decided as the short form of the logo.
        Complementary font families of Roboto and, Alegreya sans were selected to go along with the Comfortaa logotype.

        The Sto logo designs explored all revolved around this concept of “dynamic storage” that is not static, storage that is on the move and alive with its various versions that you create as you use it. “Storage on the go” was the conceptual thinking behind the logo design explorations. The iterations explored a series with dynamic arrows of information is stored and retrieved through multiple points, storage that is in a portable briefcase, a play on the file folder icons used in the user interface of the cloud storage service and a version with different font faces.  </p>

Differnt options for the indication that an item has been favorited were tested for user preferences as well (top right).

              CONCLUSION
        </section>
        <section class="pcontent">
          <p>
        With the experience that I had gained with my previous projects, I was able to gauge that the user interface, created using Material Design, would work well  since Google apps are used regularly by most users.This assumption proved to be true upon prototype testing with user audience. The color scheme worked well and was well received by the users in the preference testing exercise. However, one of the suprising findings was that iconography wasn’t as well-received as expected. There was a lot of confusion from the users as to what was meant to do what. This was an eye-opener for me as a user designer, and I learnt a lot of lessons in the arena of user legibility and how far it goes to determine the sucess ofan app.<br><br>

        Another takeaway from this project was that simplicity was the way to go to breed familiarity among users, something that is quintessential for a grocery app. Intuitiveness is a foremost important feature in any user interface and more so in an app attempting to be a part of the day to day activities of an individual/household. <br><br>

        Going futher, I would like to add more details to the clickable prototype and run more iterative usability testing to see what users want. Ultimately, the grocery list-making app is a service that would be entering a market where the heavy-hitters are not many but there is potentional. Hence, the way to go would be to look into how the current competitors are serving those needs and work your way from there to solve those basic needs in a better fashion, using user experience as the reference parameter.
