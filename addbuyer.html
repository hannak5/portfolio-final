          I identified a critical usability gap in the onboarding experience for the C2FO Early Pay app. This mandatory step, that allows users to actively use the platform, includes the basic action of linking the eligible suppliers (users) with their respective buyers on the platform. Being integral to user engagement, I campaigned across multiple departments and stakeholders to get this project on the product roadmap, successfully designed and launched the upgraded experience in 10 months from project pitch presentation.<br><br>

          Since the Thanksgiving 2023 launch, this enhancement has already increased task completion rate by 12% in less than 1 month. This upgrade in usability is anticipated to generate $3.8 million in company revenue and boost support team efficiency by 4x.</p></li>

<b>Missing Product Owner: </b>This specific page finds itself in a state of ambiguity between two products within the app, lacking a clear line of product ownership.

<b>Lack of Priority (on the Product Delivery Roadmap):</b>Due to the absence of a dedicated product owner, this page remains conspicuously absent from the product roadmap.

The data collected on this page stands to immensely benefit various stakeholders, notably the sales team responsible for onboarding buyers to the C2FO platform. Collaborating closely with a leader, we developed a formula (outlined below) to translate the number of customer requests into actual subscription fees, conservatively estimated at approximately $1 million.<br><br>

An equally, if not more, significant outcome of this experience upgrade is the heightened frequency of successful linkages between suppliers and buyers. For each successful linkage, we conservatively projected an increase in Accounts Payable (A/P) flowing through the app. This, in turn, resulted in a conservative estimated company revenue of $2.27 million per year.

            <p class="bodycopy">Analysis of the legacy desktop web product revealed a lot of inefficiencies in the current user experience of the product. This analysis led to the exploration of several user flows by hand for various user journeys. Collaboration sessions with the product owner and subject matter experts revealed the need to keep an overall familiarity with the existing web information architecture since the same users will be using both interfaces. This led to prioritizing items that could be redesigned while maintaining enough of the content to feel familiar to the existing users of the desktop product.

After several rounds of collaboration with the development team, subject matter experts and the design team,   iterative prototypes were done and the final high fidelity mockups were created. The high fidelity working prototypes were then put into similar rounds of collaborative sessions and redesigned as needed. This process was done over several sprints following an agile methodology.

          Suppliers predominantly utilize this page to initiate a linking process with their buyer within the C2FO Ecosystem. Notably, while 20% of linkings occur automatically, a substantial 80% necessitate suppliers to visit this page to request linkage, a vital step for leveraging the early invoice payment application. This process isn't a one-time occurrence; suppliers must repeat it each time they seek linkage to another buyer within our ecosystem. Therefore, it constitutes an ongoing experience, the culmination of which directly translates into tangible revenue for the company.<br><br>

Furthermore, this iterative linking process contributes to improved customer experiences for suppliers and enhances user retention. The revenue implications are significant, as the transition from a single-buyer-supplier to a multi-buyer-supplier results in a fourfold increase, according to company data. This singular metric underscores the importance of investing in and optimizing this experience, emphasizing its critical role in driving revenue growth and ensuring a positive and lasting impact on both customer satisfaction and user retention.

            The current user interface offers functionality for two core actions: initiating a new customer request and/or requesting an in-network division linking. However, a prominently featured element on the page, resembling a call-to-action button, is a misleading 'step tracker.' This element has proven to be a source of significant user frustration, particularly for first-time visitors to the page.<br><br>

  As highlighted earlier, essential UI interaction elements, including a search bar and contextual feedback, are conspicuously absent. This absence not only encourages the submission of duplicate requests but also erodes user trust. Users may be inclined to abandon the page without completing any actions due to the lack of clear guidance and an intuitive interface. Addressing these issues is crucial for enhancing the overall user experience and improving the page's effectiveness in facilitating user actions.

In collaboration with the support team lead, we worked to create a solution that automates checks in the support team's ticket handling flow. For example, if specific information was missing, the system would automatically send an email to the user requesting that information, eliminating the need for human intervention in the process flow. Through iterative refinement, we were able to propose a more efficient process workflow that enhances the support team's efficiency by 3x. This translates to reducing the need for human intervention from 5 team members to 2 for every ticket submitted, relative to its current state.

In this project, I designed the 'catalog card' component that could be used for all the different states and versions that the two-page user interface required. This universal catalog card component was added into the design system. In addition to this, the "Trending Customer Card" that users could tap to "upvote" their request was designed to be intuitive and increase user engagement on the platform.<br>

                        For the upvote experience in the out-of-network page, a "Trending Request" card was introduced. This card could be clicked and unclicked for a "quick add" version of the 'Request New Customer' button. This way if a supplier wanted to request a buyer that other suppliers have requested in the community, they can do so without filling in a form but with a mere "upvote" button.<br>

                The initial high-fidelity mockups were completed within a week and done in tandem with the development during the company-wide hack week event. Remarkably, this project earned the prestigious 'Best in Show' title, securing the highest score across all categories. An impressive 80% of the primary front-end development occurred during this intensive week, showcasing the collaborative efforts of our stellar team comprising engineers, the sales team, and design professionals. The project garnered significant momentum and was subsequently transitioned to the team assigned to its ongoing development.<br><br>

  Following a comprehensive review by the extended design team, a second iteration of the designs was produced. This phase encompassed the incorporation of error states, empty states, and consideration for various scenarios. The refined designs were then handed off to the engineers as the Phase 1 Design Deliverable.<br>

            What initially seemed like an insurmountable challenge has turned into one of the most fulfilling experiences in my design career. Here's a non-exhaustive list of lessons learned from this project:<br></p>


            <ul class="ul-content">
              <li>Taking ownership of a product </li>
              <li>Pitching to leadership and succeeding in getting the initiative on the product delivery roadmap</li>
              <li>Calculating projected metrics for a business case</li>
              <li>Cross-collaboration across teams and the organization</li>
              <li>Understanding backend processes and how they contribute to a better user experience on the front-end, while increasing efficiency for support teams</li>
              <li>Recognizing the value of service design and its various tenets</li>
              <li>Lastly, this experience has reaffirmed that sometimes following your instincts really pays off!</li>
            </ul>

<br><br>

<p>
As of October 24, 2023, this initiative is in alpha testing, and usability sessions are ongoing. Feedback from these sessions is planned to be incorporated into Phase 2 of the project, scheduled for Q1 2024.<br><br>

In the initial stages of this initiative, carving out time outside my standard design duties in a newly joined company felt like searching for a needle in a haystack. However, once I found my stride and had the support team lead backing the effort due to her team experiencing the pain of the poor experience on the back end, internal users started sharing their frustrations. The business case organically took shape. There can't be enough said about having stakeholders across the organization support an effort that improves the company, helps them perform their jobs better, and upgrades the experience for end-users—all in one go!
