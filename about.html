      <h6 class="abouttitle">Hi there! I’m Hanna Kurian.</h6>
      <p>
      I’m an User Experience and Product designer with a dual background in architecture and engineering.  I have always been an idea person. I’m always thinking of ideas that break open the mold of how something currently works - how can I better it? Will it work more efficiently if it is done this way? “There’s got to be a better way to do this” is always how my mind goes. Of course, applying theory I learnt in mathematics to real life problems was my favorite part of school.  I know, such a nerd! Well, always been happy to be one! I discovered User Design as a field that can be pursued as a career option during my graduate program when I took a “service design” elective during my last semester. I thoroughly enjoyed the course and looked into my options of how I could segue my existing design career into the digital space. This brought me to Bloc where I honed my existing design skills that I acquired during my architecture career, coding skills from my engineering program and learned new ones that make me the better UX designer I am today. My dual background in engineering and architecture has always given me a unique vantage point where I look at problems both precisely and creatively at the same time. However, I believe my main strength is my empathy that keeps any design solution focused on the user from the beginning.

        I was introduced to the world of service design design through a class I took during my graduate program in lighting design. Being a habitual problem solver, defining what I had already been doing made me realize how passionate I am about good design. Both in my architectural and  lighting design projects, users’ needs were always paramount. I realized that I had been doing user-centered design all along and I wanted to learn further and diversify the platforms for my user design into the digital world.

      <div class="ansbox">
        <p class="bodycopy ans">
        I have always believed that good design is not evident till it’s missing. As a designer, I want to change the way the world thinks of design. There is design in everything. I aspire to make design a part of the process and not an afterthought.

        During my career as a lighting designer I used the UX design process to redesign the existing website UI for the company I was working forThe previous website consisted of three pages that contained project images and list mentioning previous work, but nothing was linked to the other. I saw the opportunity for better design and took the initiative to revamp the entire website. I worked with the principal of the company to narrow down the best projects  as well as create a sitemap to categorize projects that would create intuitive user flows for the respective clients. The resulting website had a clean, minimalist UI which showcased the best projects and piqued great user interest. The new website design generated more business for the company. As a designer, I believe I created a platform to successfully showcase years of great work to potential clients and generate more revenue through good design.

        Being a food enthusiast, I love trying out new recipes and restaurants. I am passionate about learning different cuisines and listening to stories behind family recipes. I enjoy making new dishes, both in their authentic form as well as trying fusion versions to make something completely new (and original!). Feeding my imagination is another one of my favorite things to do. I am a fan of great reads, those where characters become your closest friends. I dread as I reach the end of such books since those worlds and friendships end with the last pages.
