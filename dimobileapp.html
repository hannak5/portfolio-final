              <p class="subtitle que"><b>"What is the state of Investing applications in the Finance UX domain? What are users missing?"</b></p>
              <br>
              <p class="bodycopy"> <br><b>Access to Investing Applications:</b> One of the major limiting factors while doing competitive research in the financial domain is the limited access to the apps if we are not existing customers. Being an invested UX designer that I am, this hurdle was partially overcome by signing up on services that required a minimum sign up amount and gaining access to screenshots of some of the apps from colleagues with private data masked.This allowed the competitive analysis to go forward and solve for what exists in the current market and the App store and Google Play store reviews helped shed light on what users like and which apps are popular and why.<br> <br>

<b>Customer Input:</b>  Being a company whose clients are the fund companies, gaining access to the end user was not possible. One of the two fund companies that were investing in the project allowed limited access to their end users through insulated user surveys. However, with the time delay and bureaucracy of this, the user surveys confirmed our research assumptions instead of feeding the design decisions.<br> <br>

<b>Cognitive Overload:</b> The different avenues of user research all led to one very important point of concern while making all design decisions when it came to the investing application was, “How much information does the user need to make this decision at this step?” Being a financial application, design was mindful of this point at every step. Only relevant information also kept scrolling to a minimum in every screen, hiding extraneous information behind tooltips decreased cognitive overload specially during transactional processes and aimed at improving the overall user experience of the customer. </p>

          </div>
          <div class="textblock">
            <p class="bodycopy">The design process began with the extensive app downloads of all the popular investing and banking software mobile applications currently in the market. Their popularity and the user reviews were analysed to extract what features worked and what were missing, what were some of the user pain points and how we can resolve them.<br><br>

            <b>Log Out Experience:</b> In the initial stages of the project, one of the first challenges thrown to design was the contesting of where the 'Log Out' button should be. The development team, subject matter experts and the design team had differing opinions on where the button should be located and how the log out experience should be. Leaning on the sound competitive research, 12 financial apps and 7 non-financial apps that were popular were studied in-depth to gain insights into the most common patterns.<br><br>
            The conclusion was that a majority (58%) had the 'Log Out' button under the 'Settings' tab visible without any scroll. Founding design insights in this manner tended to bring the team to a consensus without any debate. </p>

              <b>New User Sign Up Experience:</b> Another interesting challenge that design faced was designing the new user sign up experience if the user decided to open an account in person at a branch or completely virtually. Given that the majority of the competitors in the financial realm had either only online account setup or physical/paper account application process and not both like Digital Investor, this study proved a little trickier than expected. <br><br>
              Among the 19 most popular financial apps in the app stores, 9 had single screen login flows whereas 10 had double screen flows. However, only 6 (31%) in total had both online account setup as well as physical/paper application process. Further analysis on these competitors helped in the analysis of the verbage used to distinguish between an existing user who wanted to set up their online account versus a new user who has no account with the firm.</p>

          <p class="bodycopy"> Most of the user stories were identical to the desktop legacy product. However, some of the user stories had to be adapted for the mobile interfaces. A conscious attempt to improve the efficiency and user experience of every user flow while translating the design from the web UI to the mobile app interface.<br><br>

          Two of the user flows displayed below were the most challenging in terms of designing and development. The user flow chart below helped bridge the gap between design and development in terms of which screen should be displayed in which scenario. Furthermore, in the 'Post Authorized user interstitial flow', the user flow got extremely complicated and had to undergo multiple iterations till it satisfied all the corner case scenarios. Design worked very closely with development to ensure the logic of the code worked to display the respective components for all possible permutations.

            <p class="bodycopy">Analysis of the legacy desktop web product revealed a lot of inefficiencies in the current user experience of the product. This analysis led to the exploration of several user flows by hand for various user journeys. Collaboration sessions with the product owner and subject matter experts revealed the need to keep an overall familiarity with the existing web information architecture since the same users will be using both interfaces. This led to prioritizing items that could be redesigned while maintaining enough of the content to feel familiar to the existing users of the desktop product.

After several rounds of collaboration with the development team, subject matter experts and the design team,   iterative prototypes were done and the final high fidelity mockups were created. The high fidelity working prototypes were then put into similar rounds of collaborative sessions and redesigned as needed. This process was done over several sprints following an agile methodology.

          <p class="bodycopy">
        Designing a white-labeled product has its own set of rules and limitations when it comes to user interface designs and patterns. One of the first business rules that was non-negotiable was that the client logo needs to be persistent on the header of all screens. The only exception to this rule was in the transaction flows.<br><br>

        Another aspect of white-labeling is that prospective clients are shown their respective client branded products (seen below: Ivy Investments, Janus Henderson, Transamerica) so as to entice them to purchase the products. Further customizations are also possible depending on the client tiers and the add-ons they wish to add to their product.

            As mentioned earlier, getting access to end-users was restricted except for a limited survey sent out through one of the clients after the initial release of the app. Fortunately, the results aligned with initial design assumptions. To overcome this disadvantage, A/B testing questionnaires were sent out internally to test for general user intuitiveness and user preferences using usability hub. The results were analysed and design decisions were made based on majority choices.<br><br>
            Two of the tests deployed (shown below) included testing for preference for 'Account Card' design and second for the sequence in which the information is displayed on the accounts cards.

                <p class="bodycopy"> The account card drastically changed from what the initial design was to what was finally implemented in the live app. From dimensions of the card to its capabilities, it underwent a massive transformation with every force that was applied from different directions. One of the major transformations was it's expand/collapse feature (seen above). This feature was a make or break of the card itself because one of the major clients funding the project was very keen on having a 'account list' UI similar to the Fidelity app. Their argument being Fidelity is the most popular investing app so it needs to be exactly like that. In addition, they wanted account information and trading features all on the landing page itself. An argument for cognitive overload seemed futile at the behest of "seeing everything as soon as the user opens the app. This design problem was solved using this 3-tab expand/collapse feature which satisfied all the client requirements without causing the user cognitive overload.

              The iterative design process applied in the design of the account card was applied at every step for all the designs that followed. Several working sessions with the business analysts, development team, ADA team and quality analysts led to the final designs that were developed in the ionics framework. Before the release of the first signed client's app, the client's internal team did a round of quality testing before the app was finally released in both the Apple and Google app stores. <br>

            The experience of designing a product from conception to release was thoroughly challenging and exhilarating to say the least. Collaborating with cross functional teams in an agile methodology was an extensive learning experience. Yet another aspect of the project, the white labeled design was a new concept that came with its own set of challenges that I welcomed and eagerly took on as a learning experience in branding ideologies.<br><br>

    Working with several cross-functional groups and trying to appease all parties, mainly the client, without compromising the overall end-user experience was a satisfying experience that was more difficult on some occasions than others. However, each experience was a learning opportunity that furthers my skill set and the design expertise in every step. Trying to find solutions to existing back-end architecture was another aspect that was truly enlightening and one which I would have not had the opportunity to experience had this been a completely new product without a legacy desktop counterpart.<br><br>

    Every screen in the app was designed with acute attention given to the cognitive overload and giving the user just enough information to get a hundred percent form completion rate since that directly affects the product’s profitability being an investing software. Achieving this with existing APIs that were architectured for a desktop environment was an intricate task involving several multidisciplinary teams, making it that much more fulfilling as a designer.<br><br>

    Reviewing this project now after it’s release and the experience I’ve gained since, my main design critique would be the addition of more visual design elements like iconography to break up the content heavy screens and make it more personable for the end-user. Furthermore, having been in the app stores now for a while, reviewing user feedback to improve the user experience would be another learning experience from a design standpoint. Lack of access to end users always makes us wonder as designers if our tensions and assumptions were intuitive as expected and if not, what we can do to close that gap and make for a better user experience. Always striving and endlessly iterating.<br><br>
